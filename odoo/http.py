Odoo HTTP layer / WSGI application

The main duty of this module is to prepare and dispatch all http
requests to their corresponding controllers: from a raw http request
arriving on the WSGI entrypoint to a :class:`~http.Request`: arriving at
a module controller with a fully setup ORM available.

Application developers mostly know this module thanks to the
:class:`~odoo.http.Controller`: class and its companion the
:func:`~odoo.http.route`: method decorator. Together they are used to
register methods responsible of delivering web content to matching URLS.

Those two are only the tip of the iceberg, below is an ascii graph that
shows the various processing layers each request passes through before
ending at the @route decorated endpoint. Hopefully, this graph and the
attached function descriptions will help you understand this module.

Here be dragons:

Application.__call__
  WSGI entry point, it sanitizes the request, it wraps it in a werkzeug
  request and itself in an Odoo http request. The Odoo http request is
  exposed at ``http.request`` then it is forwarded to either
  ``_serve_static``, ``_serve_nodb`` or ``_serve_db`` depending on the
  request path and the presence of a database. It is also responsible of
  ensuring any error is properly logged and encapsuled in a HTTP error
  response.

Request._serve_static
  Handle all requests to ``/<module>/static/<asset>`` paths, open the
  underlying file on the filesystem and stream it via
  :meth:``Request.send_filepath``

Request._serve_nodb
  Handle requests to ``@route(auth='none')`` endpoints when the user is
  not connected to a database. It performs limited operations, just
  matching the auth='none' endpoint using the request path and then it
  forwards the dispatching to either ``_http_dispacth`` or
  ``_json_dispatch``.

Request._serve_db
  Handle all requests that are not static when it is possible to connect
  to a database. It opens a session and initializes the ORM before
  forwarding the request to ``retrying`` and ``_serve_ir_http``.

service.model.retrying
  Protect against SQL serialisation errors (when two different
  transactions write on the same record), when such an error occurs this
  function resets the session and the environment then re-dispatches the
  request.

Request._serve_ir_http
  Delegate most of the effort to the ``ir.http`` abstract model which
  can be extended in modules. This model is responsible of:

  (1) matching an endpoint based on the request path;
  (2) serving some pages that are not accessible via the router such as
      the attachements or the website pages;
  (3) ensuring the user has access to the requested endpoint;
  (4) preparing the system before dispatching the request (e.g. saving
      '?debug=1' in the session);
  (5) forwarding the request to the endpoint once the request body has
      been deserialized by either ``request._http_dispatch`` or
      ``request._json_dispatch``.

Request._http_dispatch
  Handle requests to ``@route(type='http')`` endpoints, gather the
  arguments from the path, the query string, the body forms and the body
  files. Perform cors and csrf checks then call the endpoint.

Request._json_dispatch
  Handle requests to ``@route(type='json')`` endpoints, lobotomized
  implementation of jsonrpc2, it only uses the ``params`` of the JSON
  serialized body and uses it as kwargs for calling the endpoint.

env['ir.http']._dispatch
  Only in the context of a ``_serve_db`` request. It just calls the
  route endpoint when no other module than base is installed. Other
  modules may override the method and act as middleware. See also the
  ``env['ir.http']._pre_dispatch`` method (no 4 above).

route_wrapper, closure of the http.route decorator
  Sanitize the request parameters, call the route endpoint and
  optionaly coerce the endpoint result.

endpoint
  The @route(...) decorated method.

class Controller:
    """
    Class mixin that provide module controllers the ability to serve
    content over http and to be extended in child modules.

    Each class :ref:`inheriting <python:tut-inheritance>` from
    :class:`~odoo.http.Controller` can use the :func:`~odoo.http.route`:
    decorator to route matching incoming web requests to decorated
    methods.

    Like models, controllers can be extended by other modules. The
    extension mechanism is different because controllers can work in a
    database-free environment and therefore cannot use
    :class:~odoo.api.Registry:.

    To *override* a controller, :ref:`inherit <python:tut-inheritance>`
    from its class, override relevant methods and re-expose them with
    :func:`~odoo.http.route`:. Please note that the decorators of all
    methods are combined, if the overriding methodâ€™s decorator has no
    argument all previous ones will be kept, any provided argument will
    override previously defined ones.

        class GreetingController(odoo.http.Controller):
            @route('/greet', type='http', auth='public')

        It is mandatory to re-decorate any method that is overridden in

        :class:`~odoo.http.Controller` for more details.

         * ``'user'``: The user must be authenticated and the current
           request will be executed using the rights of the user.
         * ``'public'``: The user may or may not be authenticated. If he
           isn't, the current request will be executed using the shared
           Public user.
         * ``'none'``: The method is always active, even if there is no

           access the current user.

        route applies to. If not specified, all methods are allowed.
    :param str cors: The Access-Control-Allow-Origin cors directive value.

        route. Enabled by default for ``'http'``-type requests, disabled
